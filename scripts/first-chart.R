#The bar chart below shows the relationship between a song's tempo and its popularity.
#From this bar chart, we can see that each genre has an average level of 
#popularity and tempo of which most songs in that genre belong to.

#Interpretation : 
#As we can see, there is not one distinct linear relationship between tempo and popularity.
#On average, for songs that have a popularity level of above 50, the faster the tempo,
#the lower the popularity. On the other hand, songs that have a popularity level
#below 50, the faster the tempo, the higher the popularity.
